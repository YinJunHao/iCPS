## F-00200: Update process db and condition db
Priority: Essential  
Effort: Days  
Risk: Dangerous  
Functional area (s): Initialization & Planning  
Use case (s): UC-00203  
Description: CONSTRAINT(S) / CHART(S) / DIAGRAM(S)  
* Obsolete process items will not be removed/updated directly. Instead, whenever there is a change in details/contents, new process item docs are created.  
* The obsolete process items will be archived (logical deletion) by the TrashCollector module. This reduces the risk of accidentally removing docs that are being used in another process.  
* Flow chart when task_update event is triggered. Bolded fonts are the functions.
